<h3 align="center">CPP Piscine</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Summary:
The goal of this Piscine is to introcude ourselves to Object-Oriented Programming through a syntax that we already know, the C syntax.
Throughout those modules we were limited to follow the C++98 standard. This helped limiting the amount of things we learned for the moment while still discovering the essential about OOP.

### CPP-00
This first module is an introduction to the CPP language where I discover the following concepts:
  Namespaces, Classes, Member Functions, stdio Streams, Initialization Lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff.

### CPP-01
This module introduced me to the following aspects of CPP:
  Memory allocation, Pointers to members, References and switch statement.

### CPP-02
This module made me learned about
  Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form.

### CPP-03
This module uncover for us a fondamental concepts of OOP:
  Inheritance.

### CPP-04
This module marks the middle of the CPP Piscine where I learned about:
  Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces.

### CPP-05
This module introduced me to
  Repetition and Exceptions.

### CPP-06
This module made me discover the
  C++ casts.

### CPP-07
This module covers the
  C++ templates.

### CPP-08
The last two modules allow us to use the STL, i.e. the Standard Template Library, where in this module I discover:
  Templated containers, iterators and algorithms.

### CPP-09
This final module allow us to use more profoundly the STL, primarly by using Containers like vector, deque, list or map.
